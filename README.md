## Initial Thoughts:
* I thought it was going to be relatively smooth sailing judging based off how the previous project went,
but adding the additional features ended up being more complicated than I anticipated.

## Key Features:
* Search - A search bar created for the user to find their favourite Podcast by typing in the name or word
* Sort - Sorting allows the user to search for podcasts starting from A-Z, Z-A, Oldest to Newest and vice versa
* Filtering - The user can pick a genre based on what they like
* Pagination - Numbered pages where each page holds exactly nine podcast cards
